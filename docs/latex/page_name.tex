\hyperlink{class_w_s2812}{W\+S2812} L\+ED

W\+S2812B is an intelligent control L\+ED light source which has R\+GB control chip integrated. The brightness can be adjusted by using the pixel of each color R\+GB Component L\+ED is used for positioning the copter. L\+ED is ON where we can set number of L\+E\+Ds to glow. Each led can also be set with particular color and brightness too. G\+TK terminal in Linux (Ubuntu) can be used to simulate the behavior of paparazzi response by receiving the data from the microcontroller. We had to give data transfer time to set the led glow L\+ED with low driving voltage, environmental protection and energy saving, high brightness, good consistency, low power, long life. Order of the led is fixed and the figure is attached down and if anyone wants to add led will be in continuation of the series provided

Here is image of the L\+ED we used  Here is image of the L\+ED working on copter
