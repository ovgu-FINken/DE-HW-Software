\subsection{Detailed Description}
In some cases, we want to ensure a section of code is not interrupted. For example, you might be talking to a peripheral where the whole transaction must happen in one go, and an interrupt could cause the operation to fail. So we use the constructor and deconstructor of I\+RQ Lock. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
I\+R\+Q\+Lock.\+h\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
